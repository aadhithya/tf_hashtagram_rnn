Sandy lived every day to the fullest and was a pillar of strength for her family up until her very last day earlier this year. Sarah, Jordan, and I held it together for their family session last weekend - mostly because Ruby is such a ham, but I admittedly lost it when going through their images. Sarah found an image that she wanted to recreate and the moment I saw it I knew it had to be done.

Yes this is the same friend that just had her hubby have a heart attack so needless to say her & her family have been through enough! Please pray for her to have courage during this scary time, pray for the Dr to have full guidance from the lord so that this surgery is done correctly, pray that the pain level is bearable, and pray that my SBFF heals quickly!!!! I love you @beccashere with every fiber of my being...you got this and soon you will be walking more, enjoying life and hell maybe even dancing like its 1999 \ud83d\udc4a\u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4c thinking of you and will be here for you if you need anything \ud83d\ude18.

I have to share this because I'm so sad and disappointed. I recently read that some fellow #tiugirls had a very poor experience with a Beachbody coach that has turned their hearts from the entire company. They said they felt as though they were only a quick sale. PLEASE hear me when I tell you this is NOT the norm! Yes, I post about challenge groups and Shakeology, and I post about coaching, but NEVER to \"make a sale\". I host challenge groups for girls who need help being consistent and making healthy choices. I invite you to the coaching opportunity because it's changing my life right before my eyes, and I want others to experience that! I want to help those with a passion for health and fitness turn it into a career that's never truly work. Would you purchase something at some point? Probably, as it's hard to coach without product experience, but the sale is NEVER my goal. Nor is it the goal of most coaches. We want what's BEST for you, and if that doesn't mean our challenge group, we're cool with that! We want YOU to be happy and healthy first! Now, I say this with a lot of passion because it breaks my heart that ANY of you had a bad experience. If you feel like being a coach on a team that wants only to inspire, encourage, uplift and help others, please feel free to direct message me or comment below. This is NOT a sales pitch, and this is NOT in search of a quick sale. This IS for anyone who has questions about what coaching is about. I love you all, #tiuteam, and I want the world to feel your passion.

Spearmint is very different from Peppermint, making it a milder option to use on children and those with sensitive skin. In cooking, Spearmint is frequently used in salads, drinks, and desserts, but it can also be used in homemade salad dressings and to marinate meats.

Favorite holiday themed movie?: \"Gremlins\" (1984) ...\nGremlins was a fantastic comedy film from 1984- the best year ever in my opinion for great movies. \"Gremlins\" is milestone movie-making magic, a simple idea like \"Back to the Future,\" stretched out into a bigger picture. While it's not as complex as \"Future\" is, it doesn't need to be, and certainly doesn't want to be. It relies on humor and charm, and it has plenty of it. Everything Joe Dante touches is usually magic. Even his live-action/animation film \"Toy Soldiers\" was a load of fun because of its charming disposition. Dante doesn't try to make his films anything other than what they are - charming and wildly, wickedly funny - and that is undoubtedly the key to the outrageous success of \"Gremlins,\" one of the biggest box office moneymakers ever released. Dark, chaotic and pretty darn infectious, the film's sense of humor quickly kicks into boot even during the campy voice-over narrative. The whole film is campy, endearing, fresh and funny and has a bunch of likable characters -- especially Gizmo, the favorite and most infamous little critter ever seen on screen. \ud83c\udf83 #gremlins #joedante #31daysofhalloween #octoberphotochallenge #favoriteholidayhorrormovie", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpt1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/12070927_1701151153447316_899714450_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "thechatnoir", "u_id": "10397970"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpt1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12070927_1701151153447316_899714450_n.jpg"}}, "22632569": {}, "1061235340": {"1148265413625599314_1061235340": {"m_id": "1148265413625599314_1061235340", "tags": ["firstborn", "letstalkpostpartum", "firsttimemom", "myfirstborn", "threemonths", "instablog", "instajournal", "babygavrilov", "threemonthsold", "threemonthspostpartum"], "caption": "Three months ago, we were finally able to stare into each other's eyes for the first time.

I lay there watching you, praying I am the mom I have always wanted to be. I silently review the day we have spent together so far, thinking of what I can do better. Only after I take in every ounce of your beauty can I fall asleep. I am so grateful for you. You're beautiful, inside and out. Your happiness is contagious. Thank you for smiling. Without you, in the midst of this major life change, I might forget how to. But you, you have the biggest smile. You have a sincere giggle that inspires me.

I grew up with the mentality that I am not a breakfast person, so often I wake up feeling like I could skip it. Instead, I choose a liquid meal!\n\nPure Caf\u00e9 is my go-to coffee substitute! I went from drinking 3-4 cups of coffee A DAY to ONE serving of Pure Caf\u00e9. Garcinia Cambogia, Caralluma Fimbriata, and Green Coffee Bean extracts elevate this instant coffee substitute far above the rest. It is PURE and delicious at a mere 56 calories per serving. Sweetened with stevia, it is absolutely guilt-free. YUM.\n\nGreens. Well, I could write a little handbook on how incredible my go-to Greens product is. Instagram is not the time or place. In a nutshell, while nothing can substitute raw, clean, organic green juice, today's society is on the grind constantly. Having a PURE, powdered Greens to take with me in case a meal is on the verge of getting eliminated gives me so much comfort! One tablespoon later, my body is alkalized, detoxifying, and my metabolism is wide-awake and ready to take on the day. PRICELESS.\n\nKeeping a plant-based diet is so important to me. Having a vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, organic protein powder on hand is absolutely necessary. My favorite part about my personal brand of choice? It provides my body with 28g of protein and 250% of the Vitamin D I need daily... We don't have to eat steak and eggs with a glass of milk to get the nutrients we need!\n\nAll of these incredible, nutritious components that make up today's liquid breakfast sum up to 246 calories!!! If you are trying to slim down for summer, this liquid breakfast is delicious, convenient, and will absolutely get you on your way! \nI hope this inspires you!

It doesn't often occur to me, but we are all on borrowed time. Days like today, my Colt's 2nd birthday, give me cause to stop and recognize the ephemeral and transient nature of our time on Earth. Since becoming a mom, and more specifically since becoming a stay-home mom, it seems like the days last forever but the years fly by. My tiny baby girl turned one earlier this month and now, today, my little baby boy turned two. Time, especially borrowed time, is a gift to be treasured because you do not know how much of it you have; tomorrow is promised to no man. Watching my babies grow in the blink of an eye humbles me and convicts me of the need to treasure each moment, each stage, each tear, each smile; True love. I feel so sorry for those that spend their life never finding their true love here (to say nothing of missing out on the truest of love, His for each of us). My pity doesn't come from a place of moral superiority or a sense of personal accomplishment but rather from a place of sheer gratitude and awe that God would deem me worthy of such love here on Earth as that which I share with Mike. I am so thankful to have found him and I know that it was His hand leading the way; Laughter. It was, and still is, the soundtrack of my life (that and Chicago, but that's a whole 'nother story). Our house was always filled with laughter whether it was us and Mom being silly, Dad laughing at his own jokes, or sarcasm and teasing wit bandied about among the three of us girls. Nothing makes me happier than hearing my babies laugh with each other. There is no sound more magical than a baby's belly laugh, all out of breath and squealing. Pure music. I am so grateful that laughter is still consistently the most often heard sound on the phone, at my house, in my memories and my heart. #joydarechallenge2014 #jan25 #1000gifts", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-frc/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/1661382_232266176897063_1524479466_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "myfullheart", "u_id": "25575898"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-frc/t51.2885-15/e15/1661382_232266176897063_1524479466_n.jpg"}, "700121616860712880_25575898": {"m_id": "700121616860712880_25575898", "tags": ["1000gifts", "april4", "joydarechallenge2014", "oops"], "caption": "OOPS, accidentally posted this pic for the wrong day.

Though there have been times when my faith wavered, when my sinful nature dominated, and when my walk with Him was distant at best, there has never been a time that I didn't feel peace and reassurance in knowing how great His love for me is. #joydarechallenge2014 #april4 #1000gifts #oops", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-frc/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/10249322_1496921523862226_364634538_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "myfullheart", "u_id": "25575898"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-frc/t51.2885-15/e15/10249322_1496921523862226_364634538_n.jpg"}, "659477373771451649_25575898": {"m_id": "659477373771451649_25575898", "tags": ["1000gifts", "feb17", "joydarechallenge2014"], "caption": "02-17-14: 3 gifts in giving and serving (late) \nLove.

I want them to always give more than they take. How can I expect them to know the joy of serving others if I don't model it for them?; Living my faith.

The name of the city and the flag draw from the lengthy and interesting history of the Wichita Indians, whose ~2,000 year past spawned many subsequent accredited tribes as well as advancements in the settlement of the entire Midwest.

In 1998 (the year this book was published) I was finishing high school in small-town-bum-fuck Texas and preparing to fly (on fledgling wings) to NYC, the city of grandeur and wildness and buildings taller than I had ever seen. I was learning how to hide my pain in the same place that I hid my childhood\u2014inaccessibly deep, locked tight, key thrown in the Atlantic--while misunderstanding the importance of self-awareness and self-love. I\u2019m glad that I had this book with me on that journey\u2014even though it ended up being a treacherous, shark-filled, sinking-skied, stinky-armpitted journey, I can\u2019t even imagine how much worse it might have been if I didn\u2019t have Francesca Lia Block\u2019s words (all of her words, not just this book) as a guiding light, a healing tincture, a place to nest myself when the concrete underneath my feet had melted into a roiling pit of self-conscious misunderstanding and cheap beer. Reading this book now helped me to reconnect with the fairy that lives in my Vivienne Westwood handbag\u2014she\u2019s snarky and tough like Mab, but her hair is pink like construction-paper Valentines rather than \u201cthe darkest red oleander blossoms.\u201d It also reminded me to follow my dreams, no matter how many creeping creeps get in the way. As humans (and fairies) we are made of malleable starstuff\u2014we are always ripe for transformation. We can become Selena Moon or Teeny Winter or whoever we need to be in order to fly. Magical, imaginary, or as solid as stone, relationships with others can help us strengthen our wings. \ud83d\udc9c #francescaliablock #iwasateenagefairy #losangeles #bookworm #bookgrrrl #bookstagram #tiniestbookreview #readmore", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xap1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/12317399_147177825643411_1669663909_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "sometimesghost", "u_id": "1541315188"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xap1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12317399_147177825643411_1669663909_n.jpg"}, "1058176656721770309_1541315188": {"m_id": "1058176656721770309_1541315188", "tags": ["sexed", "graphicnovel", "readmore", "comics", "sexcriminals", "bookgrrrl", "bookworm", "tiniestbookreview", "sometimesghost", "dietgrrrl"], "caption": "Sex-positive, educational, LGBTQI-friendly, non-shaming, well-written, weird, adventurous, naughty, and fun--with a smart, strong, imperfectly lovely, powerful female protagonist!

I think that too often in the health and wellness sphere the focus is put in physical goals, those that focus on performance or appearance. There's NOTHING wrong with that, but when coupled with single-mindedness that borders on obsession, it makes for a flat personality. What about goals for character development, mental stimulation, greater generosity or challenging fears? Making sure we are caring for our whole person is tantamount to health. That's why I like to balance my fitness goals (I'm coming for you, strict body weight pull-ups and back squat PRs) with goals like this one: \n#\n#\nI've been working my way through First Lady Laura Bush's \"25 Books to Read Before You're 25\" list for about 10 years now. I'll be 25 in June and I've only got a few more months to check the last books off my to-read list! (Pictured are some of my favorites from the list.) This goal is more than just a reading list - to me it represents a long journey that has both shaped and been witness to the person I have become. To finally achieve this goal will be a huge accomplishment of mine. What are some of your goals you're working on? They can be big or small, what matters is what they mean to you.", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtf1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11017637_409175905929578_866641433_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "erinrosalita", "u_id": "55795790"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtf1/t51.2885-15/e15/11017637_409175905929578_866641433_n.jpg"}}, "586811494": {"879941557746621935_586811494": {"m_id": "879941557746621935_586811494", "tags": ["gifts", "wrapwithus", "letswrapitup", "holidayz", "boxtrolls", "w3rdst"], "caption": "Need some gifts wrapped today?

As far as the glasses stores go, they are probably hoping that either you will go in and buy another pair, or remember them in the future when you do decide to buy. So maybe the service isn't exactly free. There is an ulterior motive. My Shizuoka bank provides towels to dry off with on a rainy day, but that is only because I am a customer. Nonetheless, I cannot imagine a Canadian bank putting out clean towels for a frigging CUSTOMER!

This class is a little less art oriented and more craft-type things, which, if I'm being honest, is a bit weird and out of my comfort range for me. I spend 99% of my time as a teacher preaching the virtues of \"process over product\" art but in this class I need projects that don't need as much one-on-one time as our typical projects do *and* that can be (mostly) completed in one class session (vs our class projects which can stretch out over weeks or months!). So, today, as we examined the many various ways Flowers have been portrayed in art, we tried our hand at these. They came out pretty cute, but more importantly, the students (not all are from our Reggio-Inspired school and are really only ever exposed to \"cookie cutter\" type \"crafts\" -i.e. Hand-print turkeys, 3-circle snowmen,etc) had a great opportunity to help them see unconventional supplies (forks, straws for stems, ) can be surprisingly good Art Tools!

We are a family, we want to help single parents to work less or being at home full time, we want to help people who is working crazy amount of hours and truly lost themselves into work, for college kids that are in over there head with student loans ( been there),or to have a supplement income, to build a college fund for your kids, or what about that dream house you always wanted.. We are changing people lives, it could be financially or it could be to live a healthier lifestyle, yes we so this all from our phone.. so why wouldn't you want to be part of a company like this, that has 24/7 support, prays together, guides you, and pushes you to be as successful as you want. I can't believe by December I will be home full time, and truly focusing on what I want in life.

He should thank Allah for it and narrate it to others.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari)\n\nHowever he said also \"If one sees a good dream, let him expect good, and not tell it except to those he likes.\" (Muslim) An example of this is Yaqoob (AS) telling his son, Yusuf (AS) concerning his dream: \"O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers lest they arrange a plot against you. Verily! Satan is to man an open enemy.\" (Surah Yusuf 12:5) \nPS: if people do something bad against me, you or anyone else, I will warn that it's my right (and anyone who bore unjustice) to chose to be patient in this life and to give to each person an appointment in the Judgment day. To wait in sha Allah till Allah will judge between the victim(s) and each person who did an unjustice.

In this alley, the houses all look like Amsterdam; the buildings are really narrow and multi-colored, and the windows don't align-- they just randomly dott the facade, and there's missing glass, as you can see. Everything is mismatched, and you have to crane your head up to see the top floors because the alley is really narrow and it curves. I love it; it's the perfect metaphor. Visually and geometrically speaking, it's almost perfect, but NOT quite. That's why it rules. This is what I aim for in work and in life-- I like things to be close to perfect but slightly OFF, which is a way of building idiosyncrasy. As a result, I'll make things crooked or change the language to be just SLiGHTLY weird, anything to avoid perfect. People can't relate to perfect. Incidentally, this is ALSO the theory of BEAUTY, which makes me think I'm on to something-- supposedly, the most beautiful people in the world have NEARLY symmetrical faces that don't QUITE align. The idea is that Angelina Jolie's face is ALMOST symmetrical, but just slightly off, which is what makes it appealing. Conversely, this is why you're probably weirded out by overtly airbrushed faces or cover girls who don't have contours where their armpits should be. (Shame on you, crappy photoshoppers.)

Not just because he's a horror fan, great illustrator, or because of his vibrant Instagram feed...but because you're seeing a person aspire to greater things and accomplishing their goals successfully. About a year ago my wife pushed me to start drawing again and just create. Designing and printing horror pennants are a stepping stone to greater things that I aspire to myself. So when I see someone else just going for it and making it happen it reminds me to keep pushing and create till I have nothing left in me. I have a ways to go that's paved with hard work, but I plan on trying my hardest to become a name in the horror community like so many of the horror artists I admire.

And outdoor gear/clothes. REI=heaven. \nI'm obsessed with interior design and aesthetic, but I'm waiting until I have my actual home to start putting things together. \nRecently I stopped cussing, just because I didn't feel like it was natural for me. I'm not against it nor do I judge those who do. I have plenty of friends (esp my fianc\u00e9) who cuss frequently. ~I live in Rainbow flip flops. \nBucket list goals: zip line in Costa Rica, hike in the beautiful mountains of Patagonia, hold a handstand for 20 seconds, travel to Indonesia to meet my finance's family, and spend at least a month traveling the world. \nI live for board games/family night and tend to gravitate towards staying in rather than going out. \nI'm generally a shy person with a small group of people I keep close to my heart. I'm definitely never been a social butterfly. \nI love giving gifts, no matter how small no matter the occasion. It's a bit of a $ dilemma. \nTagged babes, if you haven't already, please share a tad more about your beautiful selves!! #bbg #bbgfam #thekaylamovement #kaylaitsines #kaylasarmy #bbgsisters #bbggirls #bbglife #bbgweek8", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/11849399_1620372344904777_70394317_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "emfitlife_", "u_id": "1815952109"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11849399_1620372344904777_70394317_n.jpg"}, "986750547717585024_1815952109": {"m_id": "986750547717585024_1815952109", "tags": ["bbg", "kaylaitsines", "bbgweek6", "fitness", "kayla", "legday", "bbgfam", "thekaylamovement", "cardio", "legsandcardio", "kaylasarmy"], "caption": "Post BBG week 6 legs and cardio.

The flowers bloom from their little buds like this one in late winter in California, and the tree is an evergreen. This can also be called the headache tree, because the leaves have been used in traditional Native American medicines for treating headaches (and myriad other aches), though apparently the leaves can also CAUSE headaches, which seems rather self-serving of them. Several animals eat parts of these trees, and the trees have been successfully planted as flood control methods and wildlife restoration agents. The leaves are apparently good at getting rid of ectoparasites (parasites that live on the outsides of bodies, such as fleas and lice), and dusky-footed woodrats may use the leaves to prevent their nests from being colonized by fleas!

We wanted to create forever pieces that will live with you throughout your entire life.  Living in Southern California we spend as much time outside as we do inside and therefore it made sense to us to make Bend a line that works anywhere you can imagine it going.  In the last four years for us Bend has become as much a life style as it is a furniture company.  We create furniture for our homes and lives as much as we do for you. \nWe started Bend in the living area of the loft where our founder and designer Gaurav Nanda lives.  It\u2019s been an amazing space for both design and creativity.  For four years we have done photo-shoots, had conference calls, meetings and brainstorm sessions all in what Gaurav should have called his living room.  The time has finally come for Bend to leave the loft and finally go home. \nThis past weekend, the search for the next step for Bend Goods finally came to an end.  Tomorrow we officially leave the loft in Marina Del Rey and head east to the Bend Goods House in West Hollywood.  We chose a house over a traditional showroom set up because Bend has become a way of living.  Bend has gone from being a line of stylish and colorful chairs to the inspiration and motivation for creating a stylish and colorful life. \nWe hope that you find the work that comes out of the Bend house inspiring and motivating.  We have so many ideas for the new space and the company and we want to thank each and every one of you for being along for the ride.  Head over to our Facebook page for a couple more photos of the new space.  Yep, our new office has a pool.  Jealous much! \nAll the best,\n\nThe Bend Team", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xap1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/1389254_258997214290919_1557801838_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "bendgoods", "u_id": "436557658"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xap1/t51.2885-15/e15/1389254_258997214290919_1557801838_n.jpg"}, "896619125876035150_436557658": {"m_id": "896619125876035150_436557658", "tags": ["getready", "decor", "outdoor", "art", "bendgoods", "interiors", "design", "lasvegas", "lvmkt", "lasvegasmarket", "furniture"], "caption": "Starting out the new year with a new trade show.

I'm one of only 4 people who have done the Seattle No Pants Light Rail Ride every year since its inception. I think silliness is underrated. \n6. I worked as a barista all through college. \n7. Tom Robbins is my favorite author - I've read everything he's ever written. \n8. For my senior thesis in college I got to go inside jails and interview juvenile inmates.

It speaks of power and excellence, of protection and divine transcendence. The natural world, with its variety of environments, provides a wonderful classroom for your connection to the cosmos. Messages come to us in myriad forms. Be advised to listen to the wind, the water, and all the voices of nature. Connect with the rock people, and listen to what the animals have to say. \nIn the cosmology of many indigenous cultures the presence of the mountain lion, also called puma or panther, denotes connection to our earthly animal nature and the courage and protection that having this totem provides. It is a deep energetic connection that humans feel with the power of their animal relatives. Experiencing communication with an animal or any force of nature likely puts you in touch with a spirit guide. The power of this communication may result in a transcendent experience that defies rational thought or conventional experience. You are invited to see nature in this transcendent light, and to hold yourself in readiness for the messages that all of nature provides. ----------------- Such a powerful card for the day! This is something I have been thinking a lot about recently. bout my connection to the animal world and the world of nature. So many times, even just walking my dog in the city, I need all kinds of animal guides. Especially the winged ones. There is a whole colony of hummingbirds in my neighborhood. \nEven simply listening to the wind allows me to feel the energy of the day, and connect to the earth grids, allowing any pertinent information to come through to aid in my personal evolution and the evolution of the collective. \nAllowing the time & space for nature to speak to you will help you ground all of the energy that you feel these days. The energy is moving faster & becoming stronger each day, each day you have to realign and retune to the higher frequency. Connecting with nature and mother earth allows you to ground this energy and become a clear conduit. This makes your physical experience more pleasant!", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/10956351_1552807544998344_1826242954_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "soulstarmedicine", "u_id": "15619124"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/e15/10956351_1552807544998344_1826242954_n.jpg"}, "939536159636223215_15619124": {"m_id": "939536159636223215_15619124", "tags": ["pleidian", "lightworker", "visions", "torus", "soulstarmedicinesacredgeometryseries", "cardoftheday", "stars", "sacredgeometryoracledeck", "francenehart", "meditation", "starseed", "sacredgeometery", "plutouranussquare", "dreams", "dreamtime"], "caption": "Sacred Geometry #cardoftheday \nSTARRY DREAMS -DREAMS AND VISIONS- \nStars and stars and stars\u2026 This card uses the five sided geometry of the pentagon and its ability to design stars that fracture into infinity. This geometry creates a starry field in which the transcendent power of dreams can be used to access personal stories and visions. In the center of the card we find a knotted #torus of light winding itself around and amplifying the effects of your starry dreams.\n\nYou are invited to become keenly aware of all of your dreams, be they daydreams, night dreams, or visions received in reverie or meditation. Each offers a message. It contains some insight into the nature of reality and your place therein. By dismissing or over analyzing dreams and visions, you may render them less potent. Instead, relax into contemplation of the messages you receive, and allow your inner knowing to offer insights into the experiences your dreams provide. View them as aspects of reality. They are not separate or unrelated to your physical reality; like the torus, they are wrapped around and intricately woven into the fabric of your life. \nSo perfect for right now. I'm a little bit exhausted from all of the crazy Mars energy the last two days. I'm grateful for some respite, before the #plutouranussquare on Monday. I hope you all have beautiful insightful dreams tonight.

METATRON'S CUBE - COMMUNITY - \nThe geometry of this card is the place at which the female and male energy is joined to create something entirely new. By beginning with the 13 \"female\" circles from the Fruit of Life and connecting every center with straight \"male\" lines, A shape known as Metatron's cube appears. View this image as a three dimensional configuration. Within the shape, concentrate on the lines and see if you can find each of the five Platonic solids, or cosmic volumes, as we like to call them. You can see, then, how the joining of male and female energies create substance and form. \nIf you choose this card you are asked to see how substance inform are working in your life and to view them as aspects of male and female cooperation. Allow this card to represent a time of balancing the Yin and Yang of your inner life to promote harmony and creativity. This may be your own male and female aspects seen as offering creative solutions to challenges are projects. You will more easily connect with the substance of your inquiry. What form does the outcome take? Metatron's's cube is a metaphor for all problem-solving, not only in the third dimensional reality but in other dimensions as well.\n\nThis card may also represent the relationship you have with others and how by joining through substantive action you form community. Community brings together disparate aspects of humanity, and when held in balance, it creates a cohesive whole. Do you feel part of a community? Are the contribute shins you are making give a life and form, pace and substance, justice and freedom to the community as a whole?", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11015586_344182349119513_1964455513_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "soulstarmedicine", "u_id": "15619124"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/e15/11015586_344182349119513_1964455513_n.jpg"}}, "1418944401": {"1025508220091026070_1418944401": {"m_id": "1025508220091026070_1418944401", "tags": ["woodwork", "gates", "oak"], "caption": "Curved rails in various stages of production, from rough slab, to roughed out on the band saw, then routed from a template and sanded. #oak #gates #woodwork", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/11428636_1598756937039565_618507421_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "chesterandmorrisltd", "u_id": "1418944401"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11428636_1598756937039565_618507421_n.jpg"}}, "1621184209": {}, "25194455": {"1111742334661665696_25194455": {"m_id": "1111742334661665696_25194455", "tags": ["shoplocal", "tiedye", "fringe", "hattiesburg", "boots", "materialgirlsms"], "caption": "**INSTORE EXCLUSIVE**\nEveryone loves a good tie dye dress!

Crispy golden brown thick toast is air fried to perfection, with melted butter evenly infused in every slice of the toast and coated with honey. Generously topped with young coconut flesh, a scoop of coconut ice cream and coconut flakes that are all imported all the way from Thailand. The interior is warm, soft, fluffy and love how it slowly melts the smooth creamy ice cream that gives a cool-hot decadent feel to the mouth. It is packed of buttery fragrant and every mouthful is just simply full of coconut goodness! It is affordable and is definitely one of the best in Singapore! You can add in another scoop of ice cream for just an additional of SGD 2.50!

Last check of my watch before my alarm went off at 6am was 4:20am. So assuming I fell asleep within 10 minutes, I only managed 1 and a half hours.\nSo for most of the day I've been a zombie. \nWhen I got in from work, I tried to get a selfie with the Caz-man, with us drinking our caffeine products, to emphasise the fact I was shattered, but old \"you know who\" photobombed the shot brandishing the sky remote. Poppy may look tired, but that couldn't be further from the truth. She sleeps like an angel these days (we finally got there), but the poor little monkey has a bit of conjunctivitis, bless her out of season polar bear jumper.\nAs soon as I finished my coffee, old man power came over to tow my car to the garage around the corner to hopefully get fixed this time (we can only pray for this to come at not too much of an expense). The towing was horrifying. Because my car won't start the heaters won't work. So my windows were mental steamy. I couldn't see nowt. I opened my window to try and clear the windscreen. I dint work. What's even worse is that when I got to the garage, the window wouldn't do up again. So it's sitting in the garage compound in the rain with the window open (FFS).\nTo blow off some steam, I hit Monday night Body Pump. It took all I'm worth to motivate myself to go, but I did. Now I'm looking forward to bed.\n\nToday's #whatpetedonelastyear;\n\nI woke up hungover, went to work, got cold and started watching the walking dead.\n\n#dailyselfie #selfieaday #selfieproject #365selfies #me #family #photobomb #baby #cheeky #ghostbusters #coffee #tea #tired", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/10963991_613483692116685_769494365_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "petesdailyselfie", "u_id": "899363349"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/e15/10963991_613483692116685_769494365_n.jpg"}, "1136434652734839370_899363349": {"m_id": "1136434652734839370_899363349", "tags": ["dailyselfie", "selfie", "flu", "manflu", "selfieproject", "unwell", "selfies", "selfieaday", "sick", "ill"], "caption": "#selfie 342 of 365 - 23 #selfies to go\n\nLet it go on record that I have officially never EVER felt this ill before.

She said that I had my eyes open but wasn't responding to anything (I remember nothing of this). I finally come round as I threw up my dinner into the toilet. She said I was soaked in sweat and kept talking gibberish. I was also having some crazy hallucinations. \nIt's a common know fact that I don't just get ill, I get super ill but this has superseded anything I've ever felt before.

So luckily for me, I took the day off work to spend with my darling little monster.\nAgain, she decidedly she wanted to get up before 7am. Just as  really, because by the time I get her up, her nappy changed and her bottle made, it gives us just enough time to settle down and watch her new favourite program (which I absolutely love), \"Little Princess\". It's bloody hilarious and most important, Poppy loves it.\nAfterwards we had a play. I chased her around the living room pretending to be a gorilla, which had her screaming in delight (I hope it wasn't fear). Then we read books for a while before she woofed down her Rice Crispies bs then has her morning nap..... ALL BLOODY 2 AND A HALF HOURS of it. I didn't know what to do with myself. I had a shower, applied my moisturiser, my No.7 anti fatigue eye stick, gunked my hair, ironed my clothes, got dressed, changed the bed cover, done the washing up, done a bit of Facebook stalking and then just sat there thinking \"she's bound to be up soon\". Then another hour passed. I could have had a nap myself if I knew she was going to sleep so long.\nThis is us on the floor of her room after she finally got up. I'd stripped her down, ready to get her dressed for the day, gave her a little wash and then pulled funny faces at her through the phone camera to make her smile.\nWe then had lunch and I treated her to an exciting trip out. We went to the bike shop so I could buy a new cycling top. She actually really enjoyed it. I gave her a bike horn to amuse herself with as I looked round. \nWhen we got back Poppy had another nap (another 2 hour one).\nAt her dinner time I had her laughing her head off making fart noises. No matter how old you are, we all love a good raspberry.\nTonight I went to Body Pump and struggled. I was pretty tired and I'd hardly eaten. Good news is.... I lost another 2lbs so I've officially lost a grand total of 2 and a half stone now!!!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Today's #whatpetedonelastyear;\n\nThe Caz-man had her baby shower, so to get out and about I took my nieces bowling.\n\n#daughter #face #funnyface #gorgeous #baby #babygirl", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11199616_1461067274185400_1648664450_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "petesdailyselfie", "u_id": "899363349"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/e15/11199616_1461067274185400_1648664450_n.jpg"}, "982785228004416146_899363349": {"m_id": "982785228004416146_899363349", "tags": ["heavy", "celebrityfan", "dailyselfie", "selfie", "work", "sunny", "selfieproject", "hardwork", "whatpetedonelastyear", "amazing", "selfieaday", "butfirstletmetakeaselfie", "365selfies", "graft"], "caption": "#selfie 131 of 365\n\nPlease excuse my squinty face, but the sun out there today was glorious.\nAt work today I worked my bum into the ground. You see those big piles of heavy metal things? \nI moved them (with help from others but I can promise you I done the lions share). All our containers at work needed to be emptied so they could be moved. Same again tomorrow I reckon. By the time I was done, my guns were like they were made of stone (not very big, but made of stone).\nCome the end of my working day, I was pretty tired, but not tired enough to pick up little Poppy up on the way home and give her a massive cuddle. \nWhen we got home we played for a while and read a few books before dinner, where Poppy proved to be a right greedy-chops. She shovelled everything I gave her down her throat and kept wanting more (including my bowl of rice crispies). When she went to bed, I somehow mustered up the energy to go to body pump. And I tell you, I don't know if it was the week off or me lumping heavy lumps of steel about today, but my god I felt it tonight.

Luckily though, work was pretty easy on me.\nI got some good news today, all our mortgage stuff is all complete and accepted so now the house sale is in the hands of the solicitors, in our case, my brother in law (the Caz-mans brother). So hopefully everything will go nice and smoothly from this point out.\nTonight the Caz-man had gone out with friends.

And carried on that way for the most part. \nI had a little lay in in the morning. I got up when the Caz-man wanted to go to her gym class.\nPoppy was her usual wonderful, happy self. We had a lovely little play. \nThen I had a swift visit from my very good friend, Dan. Unfortunately he arrived about 20 minutes before I had to leave for football.\nAs for the football, brilliant!!\nAfter last weeks cup semi final disappointment, we bounced back and gave today's opponents an 8-1 drubbing. \nIn the first few minutes of the game though, I rushed out to dive at the feet of the attacker whole was baring down on goal with the ball. I got the ball first, but the attacker left his foot in to deliberately hurt me. His knee smashed into mine and he somersaulted over me and was laying in agony. I stood up as if nothing had happened and he got carried off the pitch injured. I said to my team mate who was next to me (and I quote) \"nobody barks with the big dog without getting bitten\". Now I'm certainly not as smug as I'm sitting in absolute agony with my knee elevated on pillows with a bag of frozen peas wrapped around my injured joint. I've even taken some co-codamol, which are some seriously strong prescription pain killers. The pain keeps getting seriously worse. I can't figure out how I felt perfectly fine at the time and played the whole game without any pain at all and now I'm in bits. I don't usually wish bad upon anyone, but I hope the bloke who done this to me is sitting, crying in pain tonight.

Just like her old sensory class I used to take her to, I'm the only dad in there.\nAfter Poppy had a nap so I compiled a complex shopping list.\nWhen she woke up we went shopping. So complex was my list, I had to visit no less than 3 supermarkets to get the ingredients for tonight's Tapas and Paella party. So Poppy and I traveled the length and breadth of southern Essex to acquire the tools of my trade. \nAs time was going to be an issue, when Poppy went down for another nap, I started to prep some of the food. It's at this point I received word from one of the guests from \"Peter Powers Paella Party\", that he had been taken unwell, and queried as to weather I could postpone until tomorrow. Of course I can. Only problem being, I fully intended to take my selfie during the get together so I hadn't taken one all day. So here I am pretending I like rugby. To be fair I do like the World Cup. Go Team England!!!\nOn the plus side. As I hadn't sorted anything for dinner tonight due to the postponement, I had to nip to tesco (supermarket number 4) to get some food. And it's here that something very seldom happened.

I noticed a big difference in my physical healing this week. My body feels a bit stronger, and my belly is less tender and swollen. My incision is healing really nicely. The gap between my abdominal muscles closed back together and I can fit my pre-baby clothes again. \nI think the main breakthrough was realizing that I still had my strong core muscles (thanks to yoga!). I just needed to retrain my mind how to activate them. I did this by consciously engaging my core as often as I could (lower abdominals and pelvic floor in particular) - when walking, watching TV, brushing my teeth, etc. - and in just a couple days I felt like I actually had abs again. \nThis journey through pregnancy and postpartum has really opened my eyes to just how wonderfully resilient a woman's body is.

I remember how desperate I was to have my pre-pregnancy body again, and how satisfying it was to finally wear \"real\" clothes again. Every day it felt like my body was another constant reminder of everything I'd endured and everything I'd lost. \nWith Lily it's so different - I'm not concerned at all about looking a certain way, and yet I'm healing twice as fast and feel better than I did at 5 weeks postpartum with Landon. Partly it's probably the difference of a planned c-section vs crash c-section (and subsequent infection). And also breastfeeding all day and night, as opposed to just pumping 3-4 times a day like I did with Landon. \nBut maybe even more than that is how much our emotions and state of mind affect the body. I didn't really realize it at the time, but now I can see how trying to heal physically while my heart was shattered to pieces was no small feat.  Grief is exhausting, SO exhausting. It drains you of every ounce of energy you have. I remember spending full days in bed, too tired to even move around the house.\n\nI find that I feel so much more energized postpartum this time, even with caring for a newborn around-the-clock. And I guess I can be grateful for Landon giving me perspective. Every time Lily scrunches up her face and cries, my heart just bursts with love. All I wanted was for Landon to be able to do that - to do something, ANYTHING, that a \"normal\" baby could do.

He prayed knowing that the punishment was death. David, preparing to meet Goliath is another example of courage. The Bible is full of stories of men and women who demonstrated courage.\nCan you imagine what Daniel felt as he was put into the den of lions? Or the thoughts going through David's mind as he walked towards Goliath. But they knew they were not heading towards danger alone. \"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; He will never leave you nor for sake you\" {Deuteronomy 31:6}. What are the \"lion's\" or \"Goliath's\" that you face? What lay in the paths of our children? Today, let us intentionally pray for courage; for others, for our children, and for ourselves. Bad things will happen. We live in a sinful world and there is not always a fairytale ending to every story. But I know that we and our children can have courage to face them when we walk hand-in-hand with our God.\n\"I know who goes before me; I know who stands behind. The God of angel armies is always by my side. The one who reigns forever; he is a friend of mine.

News of his death comes after police brutally beat him, sending him to the hospital with a broken spine, according to the local Baltimore Sun.\n\nFreddie Gray, 27, underwent a double surgery to desperately try to fix three broken vertebrae as well as a destroyed voice box on Tuesday. Even after doctors did their very best to save him, he was in bad shape. He died today after remaining in a coma. \nWe have repeatedly asked police what he was even being arrested for in the first place. They have stood by the description of the arrest for an \u201cundisclosed violation.\u201d They claim that officers restrained him on the ground, and he \u201cappeared to be fine\u201d when they took him in.\n\nBut a cell phone video of the arrest shows a very different situation, one where the arresting officers brutally beat him, causing obvious, grave injury to what appears to be an innocent man. Bearing in mind that the American legal system holds Gray \u201cinnocent until proven guilty,\u201d it is no exaggeration to say that until officers proved their case in court, Gray remained innocent until the day he died.\n\nWith that in mind, it should further emphasize just how dubious the police refusal to even say what he was being accused of actually is. A beating for an \u201cundisclosed violation\u201d is not going to cut it. The community is demanding answers, but the police are stonewalling us, once again.\n\nNow, protests are breaking out in Gray\u2019s neighborhood. \u201cWhat happened to Freddie was unnecessary and uncalled for,\u201d Rev. Jamal Harrison Bryant of the Empowerment Temple said at one of those rallies. \u201cAll of those police officers involved need to be held accountable and answer for what they did, and need to be terminated from their positions,\u201d he added.", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11084848_378891325650375_147622607_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "born120_2", "u_id": "1663087104"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/e15/11084848_378891325650375_147622607_n.jpg"}}, "732007888": {"1117459332048168918_732007888": {"m_id": "1117459332048168918_732007888", "tags": ["abcheck", "ripped", "ladyshebeast", "lines", "abs"], "caption": "Lost files", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtf1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/12237411_984699278253475_492707532_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "lady_she_beast", "u_id": "732007888"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtf1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12237411_984699278253475_492707532_n.jpg"}}, "313836542": {"1103737746873654512_313836542": {"m_id": "1103737746873654512_313836542", "tags": ["mickey", "mickeyears", "monkey", "travel", "disneyside", "tunastravels", "explore", "cookie", "disneyland", "sugarcookie", "rallymonkey", "disneyland60", "adventure"], "caption": "Wishing I still had this Mickey cookie to eat right now!", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpt1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/12142395_1668904399993439_2091320606_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "tunathemonkey", "u_id": "313836542"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpt1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12142395_1668904399993439_2091320606_n.jpg"}, "1014573797914189332_313836542": {"m_id": "1014573797914189332_313836542", "tags": ["play", "monkey", "tunathemonkey", "playday", "letsgosomewhere", "explore", "rallymonkey", "adventure", "provobeachresort", "bowling", "getlostclub", "happy"], "caption": "Bowling the day away!

It is amazing how the little decisions we make can lead to unexpected but amazing things. I almost went to Oceanside but I saw that the clouds were due south so to Encinitas I went. I arrived at Cardiff without a set plan, just checking things out. Sitting in my car I saw a large splash out of the corner of my eye and off in the distance. It was to big to be a pelican, unless 50 of the m decided to dive together. Alien beings come to lay dormant at the bottom of the ocean? Hmmmm....nah! A whale?! We only get grey whales through here and I have never seen them breach, my curiosity was peaked and I had to know. Squinting against the light I scanned the horizon and out of the depths I saw it rise out of the water and splash back down. It was a whale! But even more incredible it was a humpback! I couldnt believe it! I scrambled for my longest lens and ran down to get as close as I could, I couldn't contain my excitement. I was telling everyone about the whale. As I was shooting I envisioned this shot where I could get the surfer and the breaching whale in one shot, it would require a great deal of luck to get it lined up. How to figure out where the whale was though? I needed a visual cue, the birds! Tons of seagulls were flying above the water, I waited to test my theory. Sure enough, where the birds were the whale would breach. After that it was just a matter of having all the elements line up for me and I'm so grateful they did. On the beach I met a family visiting from the east coast, their daughter who is a HS sophomore just started in her photographic journey. It was such a joy to share with them mutual traveling stories and my obsession with photography. You never know who you will affect and how by being who you are and doing what you love. Be free to let those things shine though at all times, had I not let my excitement take control to lose myself in the moment we never would have met and this beautiful rare moment would not have been shared or been as meaningful. #encinitasmag #encinitas #cardiff #nature #california #fluxphoto #fluxphotography", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/11355856_867937499985715_817531183_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "fluxphoto", "u_id": "832491032"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11355856_867937499985715_817531183_n.jpg"}}, "36181064": {"720959688603116863_36181064": {"m_id": "720959688603116863_36181064", "tags": ["beautiful", "romance", "love", "photographer", "albride", "engagement", "engaged", "alcouples", "ailynlatorrephotography", "couples", "kiss", "sweet", "canon", "naturallight"], "caption": "Couldn't pick just one favorite-so here's two sneak peeks at Josh and Riley's sweet engagement session!  #albride #alcouples", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtf1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/10268815_473277026138186_1679255812_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "ailynlatorrephotography", "u_id": "36181064"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtf1/t51.2885-15/e15/10268815_473277026138186_1679255812_n.jpg"}}, "222578856": {}, "252764818": {"877758509029740479_252764818": {"m_id": "877758509029740479_252764818", "tags": ["summer", "gymlife", "hiking", "peace", "gopro", "goodvibes", "naturalvibe", "northvancouver", "deepcove", "throwback", "quarryrock", "vancouver"], "caption": "To feel that everything is all that you dreamed. \u270c\ud83d\udc99\u2728", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtf1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/891475_1528675360727392_1582914825_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "jessicarebonatto", "u_id": "252764818"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtf1/t51.2885-15/e15/891475_1528675360727392_1582914825_n.jpg"}, "763288629178747921_252764818": {"m_id": "763288629178747921_252764818", "tags": ["summer", "lynncanyon", "paradise", "thankful", "goodvibes", "glacierwater", "peaceful", "northvancouver", "vancouver", "vancouverbuzz", "explorebc"], "caption": "Do you believe in paradise? \ud83d\ude0d", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtp1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/10553991_1499917640245489_723678268_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "jessicarebonatto", "u_id": "252764818"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtp1/t51.2885-15/e15/10553991_1499917640245489_723678268_n.jpg"}}, "15291184": {}, "974011": {"768080914889486463_974011": {"m_id": "768080914889486463_974011", "tags": ["lds", "ldstemple", "imamormon"], "caption": "The temple provides purpose for our lives.

You can create a fairly complicated and accurate line drawing in minutes, of any three dimensional object, by using a sheet of glass. (Picture frame glass is one temporary option available for use in most homes). Be careful of the sharp glass edges.  Bleeding fingers take all the fun out of this project. \nIn this example, a decorative curtain rod, end-cap is placed on the desk.  An old clear piece of glass is held vertically and flat against the edge of the desk for stability, and the bottom rests upon your lap.  Close one eye and look through the glass at your subject. \nUse a Flair Pen, or any black marker which leaves only temporary lines on glass.  You could use a Sharpie,  but may require a solvent to clean off when finished and the lines are a bit too thick. You want thin lines. \nIt is a simple and very quick process to trace all lines of the form onto the glass surface. Try not to move your head or viewpoint. Take your time, use only one eye to see; it takes less than 5 or 10 minutes to complete, unless you are doing a complicated still life. \nOnce you have all the lines drawn on the glass, tape a piece of copy paper, or tracing paper on top of the fragile inked lines.

It's hard for me sometimes to accept who I am because a lot of the time I'm focusing on who I am not.

I unleash the potential within that has been hidden by my ideas of who I should be. \nIf we let go of this picture in our heads of the perfect life and body, yet each day give our best - our lives will unfold organically and we achieve more and it won't be stressful. We will become less harsh on ourselves and our happiness won't come from when we reach that goal (perfection). We will be happy regardless. Every time I practise this i am amazed at how my life flows. \nThis is a hard practise for me, I fall back many times. But each time I get back up and fight my opponent (self doubt and perfectionism), I fight a little stronger. I strike a little harder. And I win a little more.

So here's a brief breakdown of why and why not you should be breaking a sweat;\n\nHitting the sauna after a gruelling workout relieves sore muscles. Saunas are also often used to alleviate arthritis, asthma, chronic fatigue, and for flushing toxins from your body. An Austrian study even found that sauna use may help to reduce the frequency of colds. Although heart patients are traditionally cautioned against stepping inside the cedar room (heart rate increases) some studies show that sufferers of hypertension using a sauna twice each week actually experience a decrease in blood pressure! Twenty minutes should be enough to work up a good sweat. And always rehydrate with two to four glasses of cool water afterwards.\n\nThere is a downfall; extreme heat is detrimental to your sperm cells. Urologist Lawrence Ross, M.D.  quotes \"Although saunas don't seem to affect sperm counts, there is some evidence, at least for a period of time after exposure to a sauna, that sperm motility and quality can be affected,\" So our verdict? Saunas pose no risk to healthy people however if you suffer from high blood pressure or heart problems you should always consult your doctor before use!\n\nEmail us at info@fitnessphonebook.com\n\n#fitnessphonebook #fitfam #gym #progress #sauna #heat #sweat #nopainnogain #joinus #SHREDDED", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/11355284_848834285166524_2118659352_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "fitnessphonebook", "u_id": "2025803949"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/e35/11355284_848834285166524_2118659352_n.jpg"}}, "345358337": {"539258433018538511_345358337": {"m_id": "539258433018538511_345358337", "tags": ["fun", "nutritionclub", "lifestyle", "thenutritionstation", "family"], "caption": "Pops! <3", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11282107_825713397515199_860177595_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "vicshoeprincess", "u_id": "345358337"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/e15/11282107_825713397515199_860177595_n.jpg"}}, "38967027": {}, "216025494": {"1074965793286372726_216025494": {"m_id": "1074965793286372726_216025494", "tags": ["savings", "lox", "yummy", "seafood", "bigdeal", "wfm_marlton", "wholefoods"], "caption": "Classic!

The name of this popular Turkish or Armenian dish takes its name from the Arabic 'lahm bi ajin' or meat with dough. While vegetables may appear, they are in a supporting role to the meat. However if you think outside the box it can be amazingly delicious veggie snack. \nI first ate a vegetarian lahmacun when I was in Armenia. It was during Lent, a time when many people who follow the Eastern Orthodox Church avoid meat (and often dairy as well). And a perfect time for a hungry vegetarian to visit. In that instance I ate lahmacun with smokey grilled aubergine, the rich savoury flavour ticking all the boxes and holding its own against the meaty option. \nFor my version I topped homemade flatbread with caramelised onions (and who doesn't love caramelised onions?!) the salty tang of feta and finely shredded mint. A perfect quick snack at any time of day or night!\n#Vegetarian #Lahmacun #Lahmajun #Bread #Pitta #Khoubz #MiddleEasternFlavours #TurkishFood #TurkYemekleri #ArmenianFood #LebaneseFood #WhatsForDinner #HomeCooking #MidweekMeals", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/10683799_687024061431560_1157236193_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "ahava_x", "u_id": "1076021671"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/e15/10683799_687024061431560_1157236193_n.jpg"}}, "1337127884": {}, "370850058": {"945185018706194287_370850058": {"m_id": "945185018706194287_370850058", "tags": ["mini", "hairbows", "paypal", "handmade", "lafavorsandgifts", "large", "kitsbows24", "thewalkingdead"], "caption": "NEW!!

He wasn't holding a pencil correctly, especially when coloring large areas, and he was struggling with his writing. I questioned her because he's amazing with Legos; putting then together and taking them apart. I was asked to work with him on lacing cards and blocks you put together and pull apart (but not Legos) and all would be good. Shortly after that conversation and for different reasons, our son left that school and started one where he has been consistency exposed to writing and drawing. He comes home DAILY with a new  piece if artwork, or five! He is able to write his name, my name, Matt's name, his brothers name, and our previous dogs name extremely well. He is proud of his work and so am I. I've seen him write and his pencil grip is very a very appropriate tripod grasp. It's amazing what exposure, encouragement, and a little maturity (time) will do for a child.  This is his shark family. There is a dad, mom, sister, brother, and baby. He is 4.5 years old and is developing just as he should. #development #writing #boymom #mom #mother #momtoboys #drawing #love #growth #literacy #skills #gettjngreadyforkinder", "l_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpt1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11881749_560204380800299_1187157726_n.jpg", "user": {"username": "cyndishanee", "u_id": "6628254"}, "s_url": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpt1/t51.2885-15/e15/11881749_560204380800299_1187157726_n.jpg"}, "1119727348811488758_6628254": {"m_id": "1119727348811488758_6628254", "tags": ["mcm", "love", "family", "support", "lucky", "husband"], "caption": "This handsome guy is my #mcm, Matt.
